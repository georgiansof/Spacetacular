if not already existing, create a folder named mods

-------------------- sound modding -------------------------------------------------------

you can replace the soundtrack and sfx in the game by creating a folder named sound and placing the
assets inside with the same name as the file that is wanted to be replaced (ex. to replace the
main theme, paste a file named main_theme.wav). 

audio files are located in sfx and soundtrack folders.

----------------------- keybindings -----------------------------------------------------
create a folder named keybindings and start the game. Close it, and a file will appear. Edit the keys
inside and start the game again. Settings are applied and the folder you created disappears
